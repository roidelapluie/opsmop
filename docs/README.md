Documentation Info
==================

Documentation code lives in docs/source/*.rst and is in Restructed Text format and is build with Sphinx.

Install Sphinx
==============

    pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme

To rebuild the documentation:

    # (cd to root of repository)
    make html

Documentation Submissions
=========================

Feel free to send a pull request to improve the documentation for any file in the root of docs/source/*.rst.

However module documentation is generated differently (see below).

Module Documentation Submissions
================================

Documentation for modules is autogenerated by docs/bin/docsgen.py from the source in the opsmop-demo repo.
To contribute to module documentation add or edit a file in the `opsmop-demo <https://github.com/opsmop/opsmop-demo>` 
repo in the 'module_docs' directory.

The files in module_docs in this repository should not be hand edited as they will be automatically replaced.

Online Documentation
====================

Documentation is periodically published by Michael to [opsmop.io](opsmop.io).

Thank you!
